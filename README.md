# MAGtoNEO4J
Manipulating the Microsoft Academic Graph Data to fit into a graph DB

A description of the project can be found at http://www.markcosta.net/load-the-microsoft-academic-graph-into-neo4j/. This repo contains all the code I used to get the MAG data into the format I needed to fit my data model.
